# Dijkstras-Algorithm
This is a simple implamentation of the famous algorithm. You use it by modifying the supplied graph.txt file to the desired graph with the following notation. If you have a node that branched to another node say A -> B with a weight of 10; enter that in as A,10,B and then move to the next line. If there is a node with multiple branches, you need to keep the format the same. So if A also has the branch A->C with a weight 1; enter A,10,B (next line) A,1,C. There is no need to say B,10,A if the entered branch already exists. My system is set up with the mentality that branches are not one directional. Then run the program. You will be prompted on the start and end nodes of the desired path, and the program will output it for you to see.
